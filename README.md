# Air Passenger Forecasting - Time Series Analysis
This project focuses on forecasting the number of air passengers using historical data. The time series forecasting technique provides insights into future air passenger traffic, which can be useful for business planning, resource allocation, and operational management in the airline industry.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical air passenger data to predict future passenger counts using time series forecasting techniques. The dataset consists of monthly passenger data from 1949 to 1960. Key objectives include:
- Understanding trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns in the data.
- Building and tuning time series models to forecast future passenger traffic.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Month**: A timestamp representing the month of observation.
- **Passengers**: The number of passengers for that month.

Data preprocessing involves:
- Converting the `Month` column to a datetime object.
- Setting the `Month` column as the index for time series analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Statsmodels**: Time series modeling
- **ARIMA/AutoARIMA**: Forecasting models
- **scikit-learn**: For model evaluation

## Insights and Visualizations
- **Trend and Seasonality**: Analysis shows a clear upward trend in passenger traffic, along with a yearly seasonality pattern.
- **Model Performance**: The ARIMA/AutoARIMA model provides reliable forecasts with minimal error, capturing the key patterns in the data.
